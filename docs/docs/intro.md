This library is a wrapper around Health Connect for react native. Health Connect is an Android API and platform. It unifies data from multiple devices and apps into an ecosystem. For Android developers, it provides a single interface for reading and writing a userâ€™s health and fitness data. For Android users, it offers a place for control over which apps have read and/or write access to different types of data. Health Connect also provides on-device storage. Read more [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/health-and-fitness/health-connect).

:::note
If your app integrates with Health Connect, before going to production, you need to fill out a form explaining what data types the app reads/writes, and how this data is used. For more information, see [How do I request access to read/write data types?](https://developer.android.com/guide/health-and-fitness/health-connect/frequently-asked-questions#q_how_do_i_request_access_to_readwrite_data_types).
