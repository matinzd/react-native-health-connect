## Requirements

- [Health Connect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata&hl=en&gl=US) needs to be installed on the user's device, However the goal is to have this app preinstalled on Android devices in the future.
- Health Connect API requires `mindSdkVersion=26` (Android Oreo / 8.0).

:::note
Health Connect does not appear on the Home screen by default. To open Health Connect, go to Settings > Apps > Health Connect, or add Health Connect to your Quick Settings menu.
:::

:::note
Health Connect requires the user to have screen lock enabled with a PIN, pattern, or password so that the health data being stored within Health connect is protected from malicious parties while the device is locked. Please go to Settings > Security > Screen lock to set a screen lock.

## Installation

1. Install react-native-health-connect by running:  
```bash
yarn add react-native-health-connect@alpha
```
Since this module is Android-only, you do not need to run `pod install`.

**Note:**
We are actively working to implement all records in the `alpha` tag. In the meantime, you can check our code to see which records have already been implemented by visiting [here](https://github.com/matinzd/react-native-health-connect/tree/main/android/src/main/java/dev/matinzd/healthconnect/records).

## Example

A quick example at a glance:

```ts
import {
  initialize,
  requestPermission,
  readRecords,
} from 'react-native-health-connect';

const readSampleData = async () => {
  // initialize the client
  const isInitialized = await initialize();

  // request permissions
  const grantedPermissions = await requestPermission([
    { accessType: 'read', recordType: 'ActiveCaloriesBurned' },
  ]);

  // check if granted

  const result = await readRecords('ActiveCaloriesBurned', {
    timeRangeFilter: {
      operator: 'between',
      startTime: '2023-01-09T12:00:00.405Z',
      endTime: '2023-01-09T23:53:15.405Z',
    },
  });
  // {
  //   result: [
  //     {
  //       startTime: '2023-01-09T12:00:00.405Z',
  //       endTime: '2023-01-09T23:53:15.405Z',
  //       energy: {
  //         inCalories: 15000000,
  //         inJoules: 62760000.00989097,
  //         inKilojoules: 62760.00000989097,
  //         inKilocalories: 15000,
  //       },
  //       metadata: {
  //         id: '239a8cfd-990d-42fc-bffc-c494b829e8e1',
  //         lastModifiedTime: '2023-01-17T21:06:23.335Z',
  //         clientRecordId: null,
  //         dataOrigin: 'com.healthconnectexample',
  //         clientRecordVersion: 0,
  //         device: 0,
  //       },
  //     },
  //   ],
  // }
};
```
